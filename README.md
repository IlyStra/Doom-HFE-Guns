# **_HFE Guns_**
HFE Guns(HFEG) 𝘢𝘬𝘢 𝘏𝘍𝘌 𝘞𝘦𝘢𝘱𝘰𝘯𝘴(𝘏𝘍𝘌𝘞), a weapon pack for the [HFE](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?p=1233684#p1233684 "HFE Topic on Zdoom forums") doom mod, by MACE and [NMW CP](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=77513 "NMW Topic on Zdoom forums")

HFE and HFEG compactible with [Zandronum](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Zandronum "Zandronum on Zdoom wiki") and [GZDoom](https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom "GZDoom on Zdoom Wiki") ports.
The main mechanic is upgrading weapon to third level via UAC Tool Z(which are replaces the chainsaw and some other weapons) using it from the inventory twice.

## This mod is not finished yet for one reason - lack of sprites, some weapon sprites look crappy. But I finally decided to open this repository to public
